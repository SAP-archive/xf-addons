type: Details

Use the commerce-mock application to mock an **SAP Commerce Cloud** installation. The application is based on the [**Varkes**](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/varkes) project and is part of the [**XF-Application-Mocks**](https://github.com/SAP/xf-application-mocks).
After creating service instance, a new navigation node appears in the Kyma Console. Use the functionality it provides to connect the Mock to your Kyma cluster and browse the APIs.
