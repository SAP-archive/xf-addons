You can use this application to mock an **SAP Commerce Cloud** installation. The application is based on the [**Varkes**](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/varkes) project and is part of the [**XF-Application-Mocks**](https://github.com/SAP/xf-application-mocks).
After service instance creation you can find a new navigation node in the Kyma Console. Here, you can connect the Mock to your Kyma cluster and browse the APIs.
